This work started in 1998, when the first author was in the
LIAFA at the University of Paris 7, in a post-doc. 
Encouraged by J. E. Pin, he began the implementation in &GAP;3 of
an algorithm obtained some time before to answer a question from the realm 
of Finite Semigroups proposed by J. Almeida. It is now part of a separate 
package: <C>finsemi</C>. <P/>

The first version of this package on automata was prepared by the first author 
who gave it the form of a &GAP; share package.
In a second version, prepared by the first and third authors, 
many functions have been added and the performance of many of the existing 
ones has been improved. Further important improvements, specially concerning performance,
have been achieved when the second author joined the group.

Bug reports, suggestions and comments are, of course, welcome. Please contact 
any of the authors to this effect. Our e-mail addresses are     
<Email>mdelgado@fc.up.pt</Email> or <Email>sal@dcs.st-and.ac.uk</Email> or <Email>josejoao@fc.up.pt</Email>.
